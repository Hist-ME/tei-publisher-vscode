A package to help editors work on TEI files.

## Features

### Preview

Get an HTML preview of the TEI file currently opened in the editor. The content is sent to a TEI Publisher endpoint and transformed to HTML via an ODD with processing instructions. The extension queries the server for a list of available ODDs and lets you choose one.
